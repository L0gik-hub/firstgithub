                but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like 
                Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
                This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
                very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s 
                is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32
